# The Car Whisperer 

## Overview

**The Car Whisperer** is an intelligent conversational application that recommends ideal cars to users based on their preferences. Built using Streamlit and LangChain with structured prompts and schema definitions, the app utilizes LLM capabilities (via Groq's LLaMA 3.1 model) to extract user intent and return high-quality, tailored car recommendations.

## Problem Statement

Car buyers often struggle with decision fatigue due to the vast number of options and lack of expert advice tailored to their needs. Traditional recommendation systems are either static, filled with ads, or require manual filter tuning.

---

## Our Solution

**The Car Whisperer** offers a conversational interface that extracts nuanced preferences (budget, type, features) and uses an LLM to dynamically suggest vehicles best suited to the user's needs. It simplifies the research phase, making the car-buying journey informed, fast, and engaging.
